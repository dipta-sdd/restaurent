**User Story 1: General features like login, signup, and verification**

**Frontend Notes (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**

-   **Page Structure (Blade Templates):**

    -   Each page (signup, login, verification, etc.) should have its
        > own Blade template file (e.g., signup.blade.php,
        > login.blade.php).

    -   These templates should extend a main layout file
        > (layout.blade.php) that contains common elements like the
        > header, footer, and navigation.

-   **Visual Design (CSS & Bootstrap):**

    -   Utilize Bootstrap\'s CSS classes to create a responsive and
        > visually appealing layout.

    -   Supplement Bootstrap with custom CSS rules to achieve your
        > specific design and branding.

    -   Pay close attention to the styling of form elements (input
        > fields, labels, buttons, etc.) to ensure consistency and
        > usability.

-   **Form Handling (HTML & JavaScript):**

    -   **Signup Form:**

        -   Create an HTML form (\<form\>) with the appropriate action
            > attribute (pointing to the registration route) and method
            > attribute set to \"POST\".

        -   Include input fields for first name, last name, email,
            > password, password confirmation, and optionally, phone
            > number.

        -   Add a checkbox for users to agree to the terms and
            > conditions.

        -   Use JavaScript to:

            -   Perform client-side validation (check for required
                > fields, valid email format, password matching, etc.).

            -   Display validation error messages directly on the page,
                > providing immediate feedback to the user.

            -   Submit the form using AJAX (e.g., with fetch or
                > XMLHttpRequest) to avoid full page reloads.

            -   Handle the AJAX response from the server, displaying
                > success or error messages as needed.

    -   **OTP Verification Form:**

        -   Create an HTML form with an input field for the OTP code.

        -   Use JavaScript to display a countdown timer for the OTP
            > expiration time.

        -   Include a button that allows the user to request a new OTP
            > if the current one expires.

        -   Use AJAX to submit the OTP to the server for verification.

    -   **Login Form:**

        -   Structure the login form similarly to the signup form, with
            > fields for email and password.

        -   Include a link to the password reset page.

    -   **Password Reset Request Form:**

        -   Create a simple form with an email input field.

        -   Use AJAX to submit the email address to the server.

    -   **Password Reset Form:**

        -   Include input fields for the new password and password
            > confirmation.

        -   Use AJAX to submit the new password to the server.

**Backend Notes (Laravel):**

-   **Routing:**

    -   Define routes for all the pages involved in the user
        > authentication flow (signup, login, verification, password
        > reset).

    -   Use route names to make it easy to reference these routes in
        > your Blade templates and JavaScript code.

-   **Controllers:**

    -   Create controllers to handle the logic for user registration,
        > login, verification, and password reset.

    -   Utilize Laravel\'s built-in authentication features (e.g., the
        > Auth facade) to manage user sessions and authentication state.

-   **Authentication Configuration:**

    -   Configure Laravel\'s authentication system (in config/auth.php)
        > to use the database driver for storing user credentials.

-   **Models:**

    -   Use the User Eloquent model to interact with the users table in
        > your database.

-   **OTP Management:**

    -   Generate secure, unique OTP codes.

    -   Store the OTP codes and their expiration times in the users
        > table.

    -   Send OTP codes to users via email or SMS (using a service like
        > Twilio).

    -   Implement logic to verify the OTP code entered by the user.

-   **Password Reset:**

    -   Generate unique password reset tokens.

    -   Store these tokens in the password_reset_tokens table.

    -   Send password reset emails containing a link to the password
        > reset form with the token embedded.

    -   Implement logic to verify the token and allow the user to reset
        > their password.

-   **Validation:**

    -   Use Laravel\'s validation features (form requests or validation
        > rules in controllers) to validate all incoming data from the
        > frontend.

-   **Error Handling:**

    -   Implement proper error handling to catch exceptions and provide
        > informative error messages to the frontend.

-   **Security:**

    -   Use middleware to protect routes and ensure that only
        > authenticated users can access certain pages or features.

    -   Protect against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection,
        > cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery
        > (CSRF).

**User Story 2: Owner/Manager can manage employee accounts, roles, and
permissions (Revised)**

**Frontend Notes (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**

-   **Template Usage:**

    -   Use views/admin/tmp_admin.blade.php or
        > views/admin/tmp_admin2.blade.php for the employee/user
        > management page.

-   **Employee/User Management Page (**/admin/employees**):**

    -   **Data Table:**

        -   Display all users (including employees) in a table with
            > columns for name, email, role, status, and actions.

    -   **Role Column:**

        -   Clearly display the user\'s role in the table (e.g.,
            > \"Admin,\" \"Manager,\" \"Staff,\" \"User\").

    -   **Action Column (Role-Based):**

        -   **Admin View:**

            -   Include actions to edit, delete, and change the role of
                > any user.

            -   Provide options to promote users to \"Manager\" or
                > \"Staff\" roles, and demote them back to \"User\" if
                > needed.

        -   **Manager View:**

            -   Include actions to edit and potentially delete users
                > (depending on your requirements).

            -   Allow managers to promote \"User\" accounts to \"Staff\"
                > roles.

    -   **Forms (Create/Edit):**

        -   Use modal windows or separate pages for creating and editing
            > user accounts.

        -   Include input fields for name, email, password, and role.

        -   For admins, the role selection should include all roles
            > (\"Admin,\" \"Manager,\" \"Staff,\" \"User\").

        -   For managers, the role selection should be limited to
            > \"Staff\" and potentially \"User\" (if they can demote
            > staff).

    -   **JavaScript:**

        -   Use JavaScript for client-side validation, AJAX form
            > submission, and dynamic UI updates based on user roles.

**Backend Notes (Laravel):**

-   **Single Route:**

    -   Use a single route (/admin/employees) for the employee/user
        > management page.

-   **Controller:**

    -   Create a single controller (e.g., EmployeeController) to handle
        > all user management logic.

-   **Authorization (Gates/Policies):**

    -   Define gates or policies to control access to different actions
        > based on the user\'s role:

        -   **Admin:** Can create, read, update, and delete any user,
            > and assign any role.

        -   **Manager:** Can read, update, and potentially delete users
            > within their scope, and promote users to \"Staff.\"

-   **Role Management:**

    -   Use a database table (e.g., roles) to store roles and their
        > associated permissions.

    -   Implement logic to assign and update user roles.

-   **Model:**

    -   Use the User model to interact with user data.

-   **Validation and Error Handling:**

    -   Validate all incoming data and handle errors appropriately.

-   **Security:**

    -   Protect against security vulnerabilities and hash passwords
        > securely.

**User Story 3: Users can easily browse the menu with clear categories
and appealing images (Revised)**

**Frontend Notes (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**

-   **Menu Page Structure:**

    -   The menu page should have a clear and intuitive layout for
        > displaying food and drink items.

    -   Use distinct sections (e.g., with headings or visual separators)
        > to differentiate between \"Food\" and \"Drink\" items.

    -   Within each section (\"Food\" and \"Drink\"), organize items by
        > their subcategories (which you\'re treating as categories).
        > Use clear headings for each subcategory (e.g., \"Appetizers,\"
        > \"Main Courses,\" \"Salads\" under \"Food,\" and \"Coffee,\"
        > \"Tea,\" \"Soft Drinks\" under \"Drink\").

-   **Navigation:**

    -   Implement a navigation system that allows users to easily switch
        > between the \"Food\" and \"Drink\" sections.

    -   Within each section, provide a way to navigate between the
        > different subcategories (e.g., tabs, dropdown menus, or a
        > sidebar).

    -   Consider using AJAX to load subcategory content without full
        > page reloads for a smoother browsing experience.

-   **Item Display:**

    -   For each menu item, display the following information:

        -   Item name (with a clear and prominent font)

        -   A concise and enticing description

        -   Price (clearly indicated)

        -   High-quality image (optimized for web use)

        -   Allergens (if applicable)

        -   Dietary options (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free)

-   **Image Optimization:**

    -   Optimize all images for web use to ensure fast loading times.
        > Use appropriate image formats (JPEG or WebP) and compress
        > images to reduce file sizes.

-   **Responsive Design:**

    -   Ensure the menu page is fully responsive and adapts well to
        > different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

**Backend Notes (Laravel):**

-   **Routes:**

    -   Define a route for the menu page (e.g., /menu).

-   **Controller:**

    -   Create a MenuController to handle the logic for retrieving and
        > displaying menu data.

-   **Models:**

    -   Use the Subcategory model (which you\'re treating as a category)
        > and the Item model to fetch menu data.

    -   Since the Category table has fixed values (\"food\" and
        > \"drink\"), you can hardcode these types in your controller
        > logic.

-   **Data Retrieval:**

    -   Eager load the Subcategory and Item models to minimize database
        > queries and improve performance.

    -   Consider caching the menu data to further optimize loading
        > times.

-   **Data Structure:**

    -   In your controller, structure the menu data in a way that makes
        > it easy to display on the frontend, separating items by type
        > (\"food\" or \"drink\") and then by subcategory. You might use
        > a nested collection or array structure for this purpose.

-   **API Endpoints (Optional):**

    -   If you plan to have a mobile app, create API endpoints to
        > retrieve menu data in a suitable format (e.g., JSON).

**Additional Considerations:**

-   Implement lazy loading for images to improve initial page load time.
    > Only load images when they are about to be displayed in the
    > viewport.

-   Use a JavaScript image lightbox library to allow users to view
    > larger versions of menu item images when clicked.

-   If your menu is extensive, consider adding a search bar to enable
    > users to quickly find specific items.

**User Story 4: Owner/Manager can add, edit, and remove menu items with
descriptions, prices, and images**

**Frontend Notes (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**

-   **Menu Management Page:**

    -   This page should be accessible within the admin dashboard (e.g.,
        > /admin/menu).

    -   Use either tmp_admin.blade.php or tmp_admin2.blade.php for the
        > layout.

-   **Item Listing:**

    -   Display existing menu items in a table format, including columns
        > for:

        -   Name

        -   Type (Food or Drink)

        -   Category (Subcategory)

        -   Price

        -   Image (thumbnail)

        -   Status (Available or Out of Stock)

        -   Actions (Edit, Delete)

-   **Forms (Add/Edit):**

    -   Use modal windows or separate pages for adding new menu items
        > and editing existing ones.

    -   Include form fields for:

        -   Name

        -   Type (Food or Drink - use a dropdown or radio buttons)

        -   Category (Subcategory - use a dropdown to select from
            > available subcategories)

        -   Description (a textarea for a detailed description)

        -   Price

        -   Image (an upload field for the item\'s image)

        -   Allergens (input field or a multi-select dropdown)

        -   Dietary Options (input field or a multi-select dropdown)

        -   Status (Available or Out of Stock)

-   **Image Upload:**

    -   Implement image uploading with a preview of the selected image
        > before upload.

    -   Use JavaScript to handle image uploads and previews.

-   **Validation:**

    -   Use JavaScript for client-side validation of form inputs (e.g.,
        > required fields, valid price format).

**Backend Notes (Laravel):**

-   **Routes:**

    -   Define routes for the menu management page, adding new items,
        > editing existing items, and deleting items.

    -   Protect these routes with middleware to ensure only authorized
        > users (admin/manager) can access them.

-   **Controller:**

    -   Create a MenuController (or similar) to handle the logic for
        > managing menu items.

    -   Implement methods for:

        -   Displaying the menu management page with the list of items.

        -   Storing new menu items in the database.

        -   Retrieving data for an existing item for editing.

        -   Updating an existing item\'s information.

        -   Deleting a menu item.

-   **Models:**

    -   Use the Item model to interact with the items table.

    -   Use the Subcategory model to retrieve and associate
        > subcategories with items.

-   **Image Handling:**

    -   Store uploaded images in a suitable storage location (e.g., the
        > storage/app/public directory).

    -   Generate optimized versions of the images (thumbnails, different
        > sizes) if needed.

-   **Validation:**

    -   Validate all incoming data from the frontend using Laravel\'s
        > validation features (form requests or validation rules in the
        > controller).

-   **Authorization:**

    -   If necessary, use gates or policies to restrict certain actions
        > (e.g., deleting items) to specific roles (e.g., only admins
        > can delete items).

**Additional Notes:**

-   Consider using a package like Spatie Media Library to simplify image
    > handling (uploading, storing, generating different sizes).

-   Implement error handling to gracefully handle validation errors,
    > database exceptions, and file upload issues.

**User Story 5: Owner/Manager can organize the menu into categories**

**Frontend Notes (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**

-   **Category Management Page:**

    -   Create a page within the admin dashboard for managing categories
        > (e.g., /admin/categories).

    -   Use tmp_admin.blade.php or tmp_admin2.blade.php for the layout.

-   **Category Listing:**

    -   Display existing categories (subcategories) in a table or list
        > format.

    -   Include columns for:

        -   Name

        -   Type (Food or Drink)

        -   Description (optional)

        -   Actions (Edit, Delete)

-   **Forms (Add/Edit):**

    -   Use modal windows or separate pages for adding new categories
        > and editing existing ones.

    -   Include form fields for:

        -   Name

        -   Type (Food or Drink - use a dropdown or radio buttons)

        -   Description (optional)

-   **Validation:**

    -   Use JavaScript for client-side validation of form inputs (e.g.,
        > required fields).

-   **Drag-and-Drop (Optional):**

    -   Consider implementing drag-and-drop functionality to allow
        > admins to reorder categories within their respective types
        > (Food or Drink).

**Backend Notes (Laravel):**

-   **Routes:**

    -   Define routes for the category management page, adding new
        > categories, editing existing categories, and deleting
        > categories.

    -   Protect these routes with middleware to ensure only authorized
        > users (admin/manager) can access them.

-   **Controller:**

    -   Create a CategoryController to handle the logic for managing
        > categories (subcategories).

    -   Implement methods for:

        -   Displaying the category management page with the list of
            > categories.

        -   Storing new categories in the database.

        -   Retrieving data for an existing category for editing.

        -   Updating an existing category\'s information.

        -   Deleting a category.

        -   Reordering categories (if you implement drag-and-drop).

-   **Models:**

    -   Use the Subcategory model (which represents your categories) to
        > interact with the subcategories table.

-   **Validation:**

    -   Validate all incoming data from the frontend using Laravel\'s
        > validation features (form requests or validation rules in the
        > controller).

-   **Error Handling:**

    -   Implement error handling to gracefully handle validation errors,
        > database exceptions, and other potential issues.

**Additional Notes:**

-   If you implement drag-and-drop for reordering, consider using a
    > JavaScript library like Sortable.js.

-   If deleting a category would affect existing menu items, implement
    > appropriate checks and warnings or consider a \"soft delete\"
    > approach.

**User Story 6: User can filter the menu by allergens and dietary
options**

**Frontend Notes (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**

-   **Filter Options:**

    -   Provide clear and user-friendly filter options on the menu page.

    -   Consider using checkboxes or a multi-select dropdown for
        > allergens (e.g., \"Peanuts,\" \"Dairy,\" \"Gluten\").

    -   Use similar UI elements for dietary options (e.g.,
        > \"Vegetarian,\" \"Vegan,\" \"Gluten-Free\").

-   **Filter Logic:**

    -   Use JavaScript to handle the filtering logic. When a user
        > selects a filter option, update the displayed menu items
        > accordingly.

    -   Consider using AJAX to fetch filtered menu data from the server
        > without a full page reload, providing a smoother experience.

-   **Clear Filters:**

    -   Include a \"Clear Filters\" or \"Reset\" button to allow users
        > to easily remove all applied filters.

-   **Visual Feedback:**

    -   Provide visual cues (e.g., highlighting or checking selected
        > filters) to indicate which filters are currently active.

-   **Accessibility:**

    -   Ensure the filter options are accessible to users with
        > disabilities (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard
        > navigation).

**Backend Notes (Laravel):**

-   **API Endpoint:**

    -   Create an API endpoint (e.g., /api/menu) that accepts filter
        > parameters (allergens, dietary options) and returns the
        > filtered menu data.

-   **Controller:**

    -   In your MenuController, implement logic to handle the filtering
        > parameters received from the frontend.

    -   Use Eloquent\'s whereIn or similar methods to filter menu items
        > based on the selected allergens and dietary options.

-   **Models:**

    -   Ensure your Item model has attributes for allergens and dietary
        > options (e.g., allergens and dietary_options fields).

-   **Data Formatting:**

    -   Format the filtered menu data in a way that\'s easy to consume
        > by the frontend (e.g., JSON).

**Additional Notes:**

-   Consider using a JavaScript library or framework (like Vue.js or
    > React) to manage the filtering logic and UI updates more
    > efficiently.

-   If you have a large menu, consider optimizing database queries for
    > filtering to ensure good performance.

-   Implement thorough testing to ensure the filtering functionality
    > works correctly for all combinations of filter options.

**User Story 7: User can sort the menu by price**

**Frontend Notes (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**

-   **Sorting Options:**

    -   Provide clear sorting options on the menu page. Common options
        > include:

        -   Price: Low to High

        -   Price: High to Low

    -   You can implement these options using dropdown menus, buttons,
        > or links.

-   **Sorting Logic:**

    -   Use JavaScript to handle the sorting logic. When a user selects
        > a sorting option, update the order of the displayed menu
        > items.

    -   Consider using AJAX to fetch sorted menu data from the server
        > without a full page reload, providing a smoother experience.

-   **Visual Feedback:**

    -   Provide visual cues (e.g., highlighting the currently selected
        > sorting option) to indicate the active sorting order.

-   **Accessibility:**

    -   Ensure the sorting options are accessible to users with
        > disabilities (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard
        > navigation).

**Backend Notes (Laravel):**

-   **API Endpoint:**

    -   Modify the existing menu API endpoint (e.g., /api/menu) to
        > accept a sorting parameter (e.g.,
        > sort_by=price&sort_order=asc).

-   **Controller:**

    -   In your MenuController, implement logic to handle the sorting
        > parameter received from the frontend.

    -   Use Eloquent\'s orderBy method to sort menu items by price in
        > the specified order (ascending or descending).

-   **Data Formatting:**

    -   Format the sorted menu data in a way that\'s easy to consume by
        > the frontend (e.g., JSON).

**Additional Notes:**

-   Consider using a JavaScript library or framework (like Vue.js or
    > React) to manage the sorting logic and UI updates more
    > efficiently.

-   If you have a large menu, consider optimizing database queries for
    > sorting to ensure good performance.

-   Implement thorough testing to ensure the sorting functionality works
    > correctly for all sorting options.

**User Story 8: User can choose between delivery, pickup, and dine-in
options**

**Frontend Notes (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**

-   **Order Type Selection:**

    -   Clearly present the three order type options (delivery, pickup,
        > dine-in) on the ordering page.

    -   Use radio buttons, a dropdown menu, or a visually distinct set
        > of buttons for selection.

-   **Dynamic Content:**

    -   Based on the selected order type, dynamically show or hide
        > relevant sections:

        -   **Delivery:** Show address input fields, delivery fee
            > information (if applicable), and estimated delivery time.

        -   **Pickup:** Show pickup location information and estimated
            > pickup time.

        -   **Dine-in:** Potentially show a section for table
            > reservation (if applicable) or a message about ordering at
            > the counter.

-   **Address Input (Delivery):**

    -   For delivery orders, provide input fields for the user\'s
        > address:

        -   Street address

        -   City

        -   Postal code

        -   Optional: Apartment/suite number, delivery instructions

    -   Consider using an address autocomplete feature to help users
        > enter their address quickly and accurately.

-   **Validation:**

    -   Use JavaScript to validate address inputs for delivery orders
        > (e.g., ensure required fields are filled).

**Backend Notes (Laravel):**

-   **Order Model:**

    -   In your Order model, include a field to store the order type
        > (e.g., an order_type enum field with values \"delivery,\"
        > \"pickup,\" \"dine-in\").

-   **Address Model (Optional):**

    -   If you\'re storing user addresses, create an Address model and
        > associate it with the User and Order models.

-   **Controller:**

    -   In your OrderController, handle the logic for storing the
        > selected order type in the database when an order is placed.

-   **Validation:**

    -   Validate the order type and address information (if applicable)
        > on the backend using Laravel\'s validation features.

**Additional Notes:**

-   Consider using a JavaScript library or framework (like Vue.js or
    > React) to manage the dynamic content updates more effectively.

-   If you have a delivery fee structure, implement logic to calculate
    > and display the delivery fee based on the user\'s address or order
    > total.

-   If you offer table reservations for dine-in, integrate the order
    > type selection with the table reservation system.
